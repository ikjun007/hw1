HW number 1.(Create fictional business website)
I used Visual Studio Code to create one.
The website is for a fictional Hotel that I created with name "JK Hotel"
The hotel accomodate customers with two rooms.
I made home page and 2 other pages with room description about the two rooms.
Following the HTML guidelines, I made 3 disctinct pages, linked by common navigation.
